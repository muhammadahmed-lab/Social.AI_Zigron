- **Agitate**: Elaborate on the "What happens if you do nothing" scenario.
- **Solution**: The strategic pivot to the brand’s methodology.

### 2. Instagram (Empathy & Relief)
- **Problem**: Relatable "I know this feels like..." opener.
- **Agitate**: The "Dark Side" of the problem.
- **Solution**: A "Breath of Air" solution description + CTA.

### 3. Twitter/X (Concise PAS)
- **Format**: [Problem] + [The hidden cost (Agitate)] + [The Out (Solution)].
- **Body**: Minimal words, maximum emotive weight.

### 4. YouTube (The Stakes Script)
- **Hook**: Start at the peak of the problem.
- **Middle**: Agitate by showing the ripple effect of the problem on the Hero's life/goals.
